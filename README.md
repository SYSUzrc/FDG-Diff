## Introduction
In this study, we reveal that the interaction between haze degradation and JPEG compression introduces complex joint loss effects, which significantly complicate image restoration.
Existing dehazing models often neglect compression effects, which
limits their effectiveness in practical applications. To address
these challenges, we introduce three key contributions. First,
we design FDG-Diff, a novel frequency-domain-guided dehazing
framework that improves JPEG image restoration by leveraging
frequency-domain information. Second, we introduce the HighFrequency Compensation Module (HFCM), which enhances
spatial-domain detail restoration by incorporating frequencydomain augmentation techniques into a diffusion-based restoration framework. Lastly, the introduction of the DegradationAware Denoising Timestep Predictor (DADTP) module further enhances restoration quality by enabling adaptive regionspecific restoration, effectively addressing regional degradation
inconsistencies in compressed hazy images. Experimental results
across multiple compressed dehazing datasets demonstrate that
our method consistently outperforms the latest state-of-the-art
approaches.

of the three channels. Though compressed at a quite high QF of 80, the hazy

## Installation
### Create a Virtual Environment
```
conda create --name FDG-Diff python=3.7.12
conda activate FDG-Diff
```

### Install Packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Evaluation
### Pre-trained Model Weights
&emsp;We have shared [a pre-trained model](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1zwSrDczDZCYqnGNZOJ7CKA?pwd=1234) on the NH-Haze dataset, with its configuration file designated as `nhaze.yml`. Please place it in the `./ckpts` folder. <br /> 
&emsp;If you wish to test our model on alternative datasets, please retrain the model and organize the datasets in the following manner:
```
|-- FDG-Diff-main
|  |-- dataset_name
|  |  |-- gt
|  |  |-- input
|  |  |-- dataset_name.txt
```

### Dataset Preparation
&emsp;We have prepared the [NH-haze](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1kjlPWNJuHgVXb8jk4nJ28w?pwd=1234)(Extraction Code : 1234), named in accordance with the code requirements. Please deposit it in the root directory of the project.
&emsp;
### Evaluating on the NH-haze Dataset

```bash
python eval_diffusion.py --config "test.yml" --resume 'Nhaze_ddpm.pth.tar' --sampling_timesteps 25 --grid_r 4
```
